Lua Useful Functions
=============
These are some useful functions for movement, image drawing, etc. in Lua. Although they are thought to be used in LÖVE2D, please, feel free to adapt them as you may need. 

How to use them
-----------------------------------------------------
Folders hold functions and each one's name indicates the version of LÖVE2D that you need to execute them. Functions may be used with any LÖVE2D version.

If you need LÖVE2D, head over to their [webpage](http://love2d.org/) and follow the steps to download it.

To execute a game, click and drag its root folder to the LÖVE2D.exe icon. If this does not work, check [LÖVE2D webpage](http://love2d.org/) for other methods.<br/>

License
-----------------------------------------------------
I am not asking to follow a license here since anyone could program them, but to be given some credit if you take them would lovely =)
